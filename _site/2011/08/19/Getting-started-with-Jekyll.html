<p>I&#8217;m retrospectively (7-12-11) writing my placeholder-jekyll-test-post to give an insight into web development, and more accurately how I feel about the current state of web technologies.<br />
<p><br />
Sometime ago I was using WordPress. We got along initially, although that wasn&#8217;t to last as before long it became such a hassle fighting with styles that I threw in the towel and started looking for something a bit more <i>basic</i>. The installation was a breeze, posting was particularly painless, and all in all it was smooth, however I couldn&#8217;t help think it was too much for what I wanted.<br />
<p><br />
Enter <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>. Lightweight and something to do with ruby (which was on my &#8216;to-learn&#8217; list). Jekyll is a static site generator. After downloading it via ruby-gems and changing a few config files to something which looked like what I wanted, it was a quick and easy run, and then I knocked up a simple shell script to deploy it to my host. And here we are.<br />
<p><br />
As for web development, the concepts sit well with me. I can see how things <i>should</i> work. It&#8217;s the debugging I can&#8217;t do. Writing bug-free code first time is notoriously impossible, but the abstraction between what goes in the input, and how it&#8217;s rendered sometime later in one of what seems like infinite variations of browsers is where I lose interest.<br />
<p><br />
In conclusion, I&#8217;ve given up on site aesthetics, and plan to deliver some words every now and again which will hopefully render how I want them. Or close enough.</p>
